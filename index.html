            <h1>What to expect when starting Linux from Scratch</h1>
            <p>Linux from scratch is a unique way to learn the linux commands and what they do, it is also a great way to learn how linux works.</p>
            <p> This is a Very Very long project, if you are new to linux, do not expect this to take over night, for me it took 3 months to get half way and to this day I am still not finished with it, so take your time, be patient with yourself, and for some packages like GCC, feel free to walk away and come back in 3 hours, for me in Chroot GCC took 15 hours to complete its installation, so dont feel like you have to be with it through the whole process, take breaks every so often </p>
